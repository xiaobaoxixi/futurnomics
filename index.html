            Governments, institutions, politicians, universities all have female

            Between 6.3 and 10.5 million additional jobs can be created in 2050
            due to improvements in gender equality by addressing gender
            segregation in educational choices and increasing women’s
            participation in STEM, with about 70 % of these jobs taken or
            created by women.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improving gender equality would contribute to an increase in GDP per
            capita of up to 9.6% in 2050 in the EU.

            Women are 1.17 more likely than men to create social ventures rather

            offers an interesting debate in which different authors and experts´
            opinions from the entrepreneurial ecosystem have been discussed.
            Several personal interviews have been conducted to offer the human
            aspect of this manuscript, real experiences of who had to face many
            challenges in their professional path: Patrizia Venturelli, Elena
            Gómez del Pozuelo, Louise Ferslev, Ana Bujaldón, Federico Gómez and
            Guadalupe Iturriaga have accompanied us on this terrific journey.We
            (women) have a deep-rooted spirit of overcoming fear and
            uncertainty. A friend told us “courage and grit create Momentum and
            attract benefactors, it is palpable and magnetic, angels find
            prayers” and, this message has been revealed several times in this
            book, which we hope you enjoy reading.
