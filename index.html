          FemaleFuturnomics is a new venture. It is focused on developing
          meaningful projects among female intra-entrepreneurs, investors and
          organizations that have a long – lasting impact on society, close the
          gender gap and make significant contributions to economic growth.

          We think we can build a better and more sustainable world for us and
          for new generations. Our mission is to reinforce women assets and that
          might be seen like a Feminism, let´s be clear, YES, we are feminist
          but we strongly believe that female and males are stronger together.
          Part of our mission is to engage males on our cause, that it is a
          worthy cause that brings wealth for all.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Therefore, we must strive valiantly, with grit, passion and innovative
          business models… we are not afraid of fail, we will come again and
          again, because this is our vision. We are born to uplift, protect and
          promote women. To shine a light on solutions and move society forward.
          It is our gift to the world.
